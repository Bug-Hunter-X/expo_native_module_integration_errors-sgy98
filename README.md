# Expo Managed Workflow: Native Module Linking Issues

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using Expo's managed workflow and integrating native modules. The core issue is that the error messages provided by Expo when native module linking fails are often vague and unhelpful, making debugging difficult.

## Problem
When you attempt to use a native module (e.g., a third-party library requiring native code) within an Expo app using the managed workflow, you might encounter an error that isn't very descriptive.  The error can manifest during app build or at runtime, hindering efficient debugging.

## Solution
The solution typically involves ensuring the native module is correctly linked and compatible with the Expo SDK version.  This might include checking the library's documentation for Expo compatibility, updating Expo, or using EAS Build (for more control over the build process).  The solution is often found by trial and error due to poor initial error messaging.
