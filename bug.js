This error occurs when using the Expo managed workflow and attempting to access a native module that isn't properly linked or isn't compatible with the Expo SDK version.  This frequently happens when integrating third-party libraries that rely on native code.  The error message itself is often not very specific, making debugging challenging.  It might manifest as a runtime error or a build failure, depending on the library and how it's integrated.
