While a specific fix depends on the library and the error, here's a general approach:

1. **Verify Library Compatibility:** Check the library's documentation or repository for information about compatibility with the Expo SDK version you are using.
2. **Update Expo:** Ensure that Expo CLI and the project's dependencies are up-to-date.  Run `expo upgrade` and update package.json.
3. **EAS Build (Recommended):** If feasible, switch to Expo's EAS Build system.  This gives you better control over the native build process, and sometimes provides clearer error messages.
4. **Check for Correct Linking:**  If the library requires manual linking (uncommon with well-maintained Expo-compatible libraries), consult its documentation carefully.  Usually, no manual linking is needed for packages that work with Expo's managed workflow.
5. **Inspect the Detailed Error Message:**  Carefully examine the complete error message, including stack traces.  Look for clues indicating the specific part of the native module that failed to link.
6. **Community Support:** Search for related issues on the library's GitHub repository or the Expo community forums.  Others might have encountered similar problems and found a solution.

//Example (Illustrative - Replace with your actual code and library)
//bug.js
import { MyNativeModule } from 'my-native-module'; // problematic native module

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{MyNativeModule.someNativeMethod()}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

//bugSolution.js (Illustrative)
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

//If the problem is solved by updating a native dependency
//Try upgrading the expo version: expo upgrade
//If the problem is solved by the correct expo installation, try using:
expo init <project-name> --template expo-template-blank

//or by using EAS build, and follow the respective setup

export default function App() {
  //Solution by correct native linking or choosing another alternative solution
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This problem is now solved!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
